            Growing up I didn't get much access to the growing Technology field,
            I dealt with lower/older devices until I became a teenager and could
            pay for my own devices. After this I fell in love with everything
            technical, weither that what taking apart the old devices that I no
            longer needed or playing the newest games I was hooked. During this
            time a School sent me a brochure about their school and how it was
            entirely technology based with learning how to code the different
            aspects of our new life. I applied, got accepted and started my
            journey into the tech world.
