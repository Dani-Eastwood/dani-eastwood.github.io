            <small>September 1, 2020, Tom was Daniel's teacher</small>
            <p>
              Danny was a student in several courses I taught in the Web Design
              and Development program and Neumont College of Computer Science.
              In the years that I have known him, he has grown into a solid and
              dependable developer that is capable of quickly picking up new
              technologies. He would be a good addition to any development team.
